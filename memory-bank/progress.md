# Progress for Gaggle Rails Engine

## Current Status
- Finalized model design and business logic for the engine.
- Active Context has been updated to reflect the design choices:
  - All models are namespaced under the `Gaggle` module (i.e. `Gaggle::Goose`, `Gaggle::Thread`, `Gaggle::Message`, and `Gaggle::Notification`).
  - There are no polymorphic associations. Instead, `Gaggle::Message` belongs to `Gaggle::Goose` optionally—where a nil value indicates the message was sent by the user.
  - `Gaggle::Thread` has no direct association with geese; participants are derived from the senders of messages.
  - Notification logic is defined such that when a message is created:
    - If it is sent by the user (nil sender), all geese that have previously participated in the thread are notified.
    - Additionally, an "@goose_name" mention in the message triggers a targeted notification to that goose even if they haven’t yet participated.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Namespacing:** Ensures smooth integration with host applications by avoiding naming conflicts.
- **Association Simplification:** Relationships are derived from message data, eliminating the need for dedicated join tables or polymorphic associations.
- **Notification Workflow:** Clearly defined rules for how and when notifications are generated, minimizing complexity during development.

## Next Steps
1. Implement database migrations for:
   - `gaggle_gooses`
   - `gaggle_threads`
   - `gaggle_messages`
   - `gaggle_notifications`
2. Develop the corresponding model classes based on the design.
3. Create callbacks or service objects within `Gaggle::Message` to trigger notification generation.
4. Write tests to cover model validations, associations, and notification logic.
5. Update supporting documentation (CHANGELOG, ADRs) as the implementation evolves.

## Notes
- This design is targeted for development purposes and may evolve as implementation progresses.
- Future modifications may be required based on further testing and integration with host applications.
